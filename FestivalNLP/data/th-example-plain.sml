The March Hare took the watch and looked at it <sadness 1 5 1000/> gloomily: then he dipped it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of nothing better to say than his first remark, It was <sadness 1 5 1800/> the best butter, you know. 

<pause msec="400"/>

Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. What <surprise 2 7 2000/> a funny watch! she remarked. It <surprise 2 7 3000/> tells the day of the month, and doesn't tell what o'clock it is! 

<pause msec="400"/>

Why <anger 2 3 1000/> should it? muttered the Hatter. Does your watch tell you what year it is? 

<pause msec="400"/>

Of <anger 2 6 1000/> course not, Alice replied very readily. But that's because it stays the same year for such a long time together. 

<pause msec="400"/>

Which <sadness 2 6 3000/> is just the case with mine, said the Hatter. 

<pause msec="400"/>

Alice <confused 2 7 4000/> felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatter's remark seemed to have no sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English.
