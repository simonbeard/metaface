Long ergo in Arabiaa, 
the Sultin Symin, had threee sonss, 
and their names were John, Ben, and Paul,
When they were grown to the flaawir of youtthhh, 
and when they were finished with schooling and with books, 
and were trained in the arts of war, 
so that no man could stand up against them either with sord or with spear, 
the Sultin called his sons to him
