Hi all, 
	As you have seen, the new time for the lecture for CG is on a
wednesday from 7:30 to 9:30. I am sorry that this is the new time and that
it may cause problems for some of you.

The situation is that I made a mistake in thinking that CG252 was on a monday
night not on the tuesday. Because of family commitments, this time was
extremely difficult for me and as soon as I realised the problem, I
attempted to look for a solution that would affect as few people as
possible.

After talking with Mary Simpson, the swap with DB252 seemed ideal
and Raj was happy to help out.  Unfortunately it turned out that there were
some unforseen students who could NOT attend the new DB252 time of 5:30 - 7:30
and so that time was not possible. We then looked for solutions in making
the swap work but after several attempts it was abandoned.

We then looked for the best free 2 hour slot at night.
Initially monday was thought to be ok but that clashes with 2 core units.
The only free slot besides friday night was on the wed 7:30 - 9:30.
Friday night is ok for me but I doubt if you lot would be happy :?)
