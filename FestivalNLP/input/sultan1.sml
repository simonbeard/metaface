Long ago in Arabia, the Sultin Symin, had three sons, and their names were John, Ben, and Paul.  When they were grown to the flower of youth, 
and when they were finished with schooling and with books; 
and were trained in the arts of war, 
so that no man could stand up against them either with sword or with spear.
The Sultin then called his sons to him.
