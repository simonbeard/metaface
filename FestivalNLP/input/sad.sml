<p>
<sad>I opened the drawer of my little desk and a single letter fell out, <pause length="long"/>a
letter from my mother, written in pencil, one of her last, with unfinished
words and an implicit sense of her departure.  
</sad>
</p>

<p>
<sad>It's so curious: one can
resist tears and 'behave' very well in the hardest hours of grief.</sad>
</p>

<p>
<sad>But then someone makes you a friendly sign behind a window... <pause/>or one notices
that a flower that was in bud only yesterday has suddenly blossomed... <pause/>or
a letter slips from a drawer... <pause length="long"/>and everything collapses.
