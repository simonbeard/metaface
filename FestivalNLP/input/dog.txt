<neutral>I have a virtual friend called jacob

</p><p>
<neutral>I have a story for you jacob:

</neutral>
</p><p>
<neutral>A little dog goes into a saloon in the Wild West, and beckons to
the bartender.
</neutral>
</p><p>
<neutral><speaker gender="male" name="us1">'Hey, bartender, gimme a whiskey.'
</speaker></neutral>
</p><p>
<neutral>The bartender ignores him.
</neutral>
</p><p>
<neutral><speaker gender="male" name="us1">'Hey bartender, gimme a whiskey!'
</speaker></neutral>
</p><p>
<neutral>Still ignored.
</neutral>
</p><p>
<neutral><speaker gender="male" name="us1">'HEY BARMAN!!  GIMME A WHISKEY!!'
</speaker></neutral>
</p><p>
<neutral>The bartender takes out his six-shooter and shoots the dog in the
leg, and the dog runs out the saloon, howling in pain.
</neutral>
</p><p>
<neutral>Three years later, the wee dog appears again, wearing boots,
jeans, chaps, a Stetson, gun belt, and guns.  <pause/>He ambles slowly into the
saloon, goes up to the bar, leans over it, and says to the bartender,
</neutral>
</p><p>
<neutral><speaker gender="male" name="us1">'I'm here to git the man that shot muh paw.'
</speaker></neutral>

<neutral></neutral>
