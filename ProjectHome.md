The **MetaFace** framework aims to provide developers with an extensible anthropomorphic framework to achieve intuitive user interaction for websites. This will enable developers to construct websites based on anthropomorphic metaphors, such as, _lecturers_, _shopkeepers_, _bank tellers_, and _tour guides_.
