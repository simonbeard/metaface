Hi all,
	As you have seen, the new time for the lecture for CG is on a
wednesday from 7:30 to 9:30. I am sorry that this is the new time and that
it may cause problems for some of you.

The situation is that I made a mistake in thinking that CG252 was on a monday
night not on the tuesday. Because of family commitments, this time was
extremely difficult for me and as soon as I realised the problem, I
attempted to look for a solution that would affect as few people as
possible. After talking with Mary Simpson, the swap with DB252 seemed ideal
and Raj was happy to help out.  Unfortunately it turned out that there were
some unforseen students who could NOT attend the new DB252 time of 5:30 -> 7:30
and so that time was not possible. We then looked for solutions in making
the swap work but after several attempts it was abandoned.

We then looked for the best free 2 hour slot at night.
Initially monday was thought to be ok but that clashes with 2 core units.
The only free slot besides friday night was on the wed 7:30 ->9:30.
Friday night is ok for me but I doubt if you lot would be happy :?)

Trying to solve the problem is not simple, we cannot simply have it during
the day as many part-time and graduate students would then complain.
Remember that there are approximately 140+ students in the unit from many
disciplines, some full-time, some part-time.

If you have a definite problem re tutorials AND it is legitimate then I will
try to help in minimising the hassle to you. I am looking at trying to move
the monday 5:30-6:30 tute WITH THE PEOPLE IN IT to the new time of Wed
6:30->7:30 or if that is not possible, trying to move the early Thurs
10.00->11:00 tute to that spot. This DOESN'T mean that
everyone can now move into that tute, it just means I am trying to minimise
the damage that I have caused. It needs your cooperation and patience.

So please be patient.
Thanks for your time.
bye for now
