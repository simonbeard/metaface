The Science Fair event was located inside an indoor school gymnasium.  Our location from the gym entrance was along the back 
wall next to the left corner display, which happened to be for a survey table for the actual Science Fair.  Their questionnaires 
were blue and ours were white.  It was a good idea to have two identifying pictures of the Talking Head on our questionnaire 
for association purposes.
