The Sultin said to his sons,
"My bearrrrdd is white and my arm growsss weak, 
In the course of time, 
I will die and one of you will riplace me, 
Therefore I will now hold a test to see which of you is the fittist to 
sit as Sultin in my place,
Each of you will go out and travilll and bring back that 
which you find in the world, 
And from that which you bring back, 
and from what you relate of your travillls, 
I will judge you, 
Therefore take horses and dipart, 
and may you all jerney in helltthhhh"
