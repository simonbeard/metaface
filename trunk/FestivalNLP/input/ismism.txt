Damn it <pause/>I know you're in a bit of a spot,
and you're used to the Merc and the Moet and the yacht.
And it must be a blow to the ego, what! <pause/>
But forget about this video rot 
and write yourselves a hit or three,
like, "I'm Not in Paris" or "The Dean and Me".

I mean really I don't like your stuff very much,
it's too avant garde and aggressive and butch.
I prefer a gentle and melodic touch 
but the kids today have got their ears in their crutch.
If it's not robots singing in Dutch <pause/>
it's Adam and the Ants and Starsky and Hutch.
By the way <pause/> here's your present, Thanks very much.
Now <pause/> who's here?
